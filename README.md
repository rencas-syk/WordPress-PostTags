# WordPress-PostTags
small practice plugin for wordpress which adds an interface for assigning/editing/removing custom tags under the "Posts" administrator menu. <br>
This plugin does (should) not have any relevant functionality in a production context. This was created for displaying my progress in learning WP-WebDev only.
